# Wealth-Management-Platform
The Investment Banking Platform is a modern, production-ready application designed for wealth management and financial planning. Built with Spring Boot and ReactJS/TypeScript, it leverages microservices architecture for scalability and modularity. Key features include GraphQL APIs, Netflix DGS, Spring AI, and event-driven communication via Kafka.

## Project Overview
This wealth management project allows users to manage their investments, view portfolio performance, and receive insights. The backend is built using Java and Spring, exposing a GraphQL API, while the frontend is developed using React with TypeScript.

## Plan
1. Define project structure and features:
    - User authentication
    - Portfolio management
    - Transaction history
    - Insights and analytics
2. Create wireframes for key pages.
3. Design the database schema.

## Design
- **Wireframes**: Design key interfaces including:
    - Dashboard (Portfolio Overview)
    - Investment Details
    - Transaction History
    - User Settings
- **Database Schema**:
    - Users: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`
    - Portfolios: `portfolio_id`, `user_id`, `total_value`
    - Investments: `investment_id`, `portfolio_id`, `asset_type`, `quantity`
    - Transactions: `transaction_id`, `user_id`, `investment_id`, `date`, `amount`

## Backend Development
1. **Setup Spring Boot Project**:
    - Create a new Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, GraphQL).
2. **Implement Models and Repositories**:
    - Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code for entity classes (User, Portfolio, Investment, Transaction).
3. **Service Layer**:
    - Develop service classes for handling business logic (e.g., `PortfolioService`, `InvestmentService`).
4. **GraphQL API with Netflix DGS**:
    - Define GraphQL schema for queries and mutations.
    - Implement resolvers for handling API requests.
5. **MapStruct Integration**:
    - Use MapStruct for mapping between entity and DTO.

## Frontend Development
1. **Setup React Project**:
    - Create a new React project with TypeScript; install dependencies (Tanstack Query, ag-Grid, Bootstrap).
2. **Build Components**:
    - Develop components for the dashboard, investment details, transaction history.
3. **Integrate API Calls**:
    - Use Tanstack Query for fetching data from the GraphQL API.
    - Implement ag-Grid for displaying portfolio and transaction data.
4. **Styling**:
    - Utilize Bootstrap for responsive design and styling.

## Testing
1. **Unit Testing**:
    - Backend: Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito for services and controllers.
    - Frontend: Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
2. **Integration Testing**:
    - Test the interaction between frontend and backend to ensure GraphQL functionality.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
    - Conduct UAT to gather feedback from potential users and make adjustments.

## Deployment
1. **Prepare for Deployment**:
    - Backend: Package the Spring Boot application as a JAR file.
    - Frontend: Build the React application for production.
2. **Choose a Deployment Platform**:
    - Decide on a deployment platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
3. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions or similar tools for automated testing and deployment.
4. **Monitor and Maintain**:
    - Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and errors.
